# Title


## Description

-As a web developer I will need to include readme files on my projects and this readme generator will help with that.
-It solves the problem of producing readme files from scratch each time I need to create one therefore it will save time.
-I learned to work wit node.js and to identify the specific criteria required in a professional readme file.
-I believe this project stands out for me in the fact that it's my first project using node.js and using the local server environment.
-It took me several attempts to have it function properly in regard to receiving the prompts, also using the npm for the first time is new and so it's just a bit to get used to.
