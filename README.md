# Title

Professional Readme Generator



## Description

As a developer I will need to create many readme files and this will be helpful for that job.
It solves the problem of needing to constantly be producing readme files from scratch.
I learned to use node.js,json,the node packages like fs, and inquirer.
It to a while to get my prompts to show up in the terminal and once that was resolved it also was a lot of detail work connectin thevarious setions from the index.js prompts to the functions in generateMarkdown.js file to finally the readme itself. Also the info and links for the licenses and badges , not to mention this is the first project requiring a vedio demo.
