# Title

Professional Readme Generator



## Description

As a developer I will need to create many readme files and this will be a great tool to use for the purpose.
It solves the problem of constantly needing to create readme files from scratch.
I learned to work with node.js, json and the node packages fs and iquirer.
Initially it took me a while to get the prompts to come up in the terminal and then once that worked out it was a lot of detail type work to properly link the answers to the prompts to the functions in the generateMarkdown.js file and next and finally to the readme file itself. Also linking the licenses and badges data as well as this was the first project requiring a demo video, so that process was new to me as well.
